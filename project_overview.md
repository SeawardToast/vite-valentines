# Project Overview

## What Is This?

A Valentine's Day website to send to my wife — it should make her smile and reveal a dinner reservation surprise.

## Stack

- **Vite** — build tool
- **React** + **TypeScript** — UI
- **CSS** — styling (animations, effects)

## Vibe & Design

### Color Palette
- **Primary:** Romantic purples (`#7B2D8E`, `#9B59B6`, `#C39BD3`)
- **Accent:** Soft pinks (`#E91E63`, `#F48FB1`, `#FCE4EC`)
- **Background:** Deep purple-to-pink gradients
- **Text:** Soft whites and light pinks for contrast

### Feel
- **Floaty** — elements should feel weightless, drifting gently
- **Soft** — rounded edges, blur effects, gentle glows
- **Romantic** — warm tones, elegant typography, intimate atmosphere

### Animations & Effects
This site should **wow**. Every interaction and transition should feel polished:
- Floating particles (hearts, sparkles, petals)
- Smooth page/section transitions with fades and slides
- Parallax or depth effects
- Gentle pulsing glows on key elements
- Text reveal animations
- Background effects (gradient shifts, bokeh, soft light rays)
- Hover effects that feel alive and responsive

### Typography
- Elegant serif or script fonts for headings
- Clean, readable sans-serif for body text

## Core Flow

1. **Landing** — A romantic greeting / love message with ambient effects
2. **Message/Story** — Personal message or timeline of memories
3. **The Reveal** — Dinner reservation details presented as a surprise moment

## Goal

Make her say "wow" and feel loved.
